Bangladesh is a small country with a
huge population. There are also many
arable lands here which are not being
cultivated. They are fallen as barren
land. If we can cultivate these
abandoned lands all across the country
by the aid of the Government officially,
we can reduce the food crisis of the
Bangladeshi people. In order to do so,
we intend to detect arable & non arable
lands by deep learning process and
also to differentiate arable lands from
the non arable ones in order to produce
a collected of the arable lands in
Bangladesh.
